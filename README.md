## 1. Situation
Analyzed over **1,000 Amazon product records** to evaluate market performance and customer sentiment across nine distinct categories.
## 2. Task
The goal was to identify top-performing products, assess the impact of pricing on ratings, and track user engagement metrics to optimize inventory strategy.
## 3. Action
Cleaned raw data and utilized **Power BI** to build an interactive dashboard.
* **KPI Development:** Calculated key metrics including **Total Ratings (17M)** to gauge market reach.
* **Visual Analysis:** Created scatter plots to test price correlations and combo charts to compare category performance.
## 4. Results & Insights
* **Overall Rating:** The dataset revealed a strong average product rating of **4.1**.
* **Pricing Insight:** Analysis demonstrated that **deep discounts did not drive higher customer ratings**, debunking a common pricing strategy.
* **Top Category:** "Electronics" showed the highest user engagement (**385 reviews**) despite having lower discounts than other sectors.
## 5. Recommendation
* **Strategy Pivot:** Shift away from aggressive discounting as a tool to boost ratings, as the data proved there is no correlation.
* **Inventory Planning:** Focus inventory resources on the **Electronics** category to capitalize on high organic engagement.
